# Link2Home integration for Home Assistant

This integration provides control and Link2Home smart sockets from Home Assistant

⚠️ This is under development and in very early stage! ⚠️ This project is based on reverse engineering and is neither associated nor supported by the offical product. This is mere a workaround to the missing of an official open API or third party integrations

As of now, this library has been developed and tested solely with a EMQ303WF-1 smart socket
